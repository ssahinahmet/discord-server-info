<b>UPDATE CLARIFICATION:</b><br>
 <p> I made some significant changes to how certain things in the command functions, and added new information to be displayed as well, such as the server "Features".</p><br>
  <p> It's more rich on features and has been cleaned up a bit since the last version I posted, so I'm certain you'll want to upgrade. </p>
